# Component Organization Patterns

This document outlines different approaches to organizing Vue.js components in a Laravel + Vue 3 + Inertia.js application. Each pattern has its own benefits for managing complexity and maintaining clear component relationships.

## 1. Component Type Organization

Organize by the type/role of components rather than by feature.

```
resources/js/
├── components/
│   ├── layouts/           # All layout components
│   │   ├── MainLayout.vue
│   │   ├── ThreeColumnLayout.vue
│   │   └── SidebarWithTestingLayout.vue
│   ├── content/           # All content components
│   │   ├── HeaderTools.vue
│   │   ├── NavigationItems.vue
│   │   └── RightPanelContent.vue
│   ├── composite/         # Components that compose others
│   │   └── TestingWorkspace.vue
│   └── ui/               # Basic UI building blocks
│       ├── card/
│       └── sample/
└── pages/                # Page-level components only
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation by component responsibility
- Easy to find all layouts or all content components
- Reduces feature-based complexity

**Drawbacks:**
- Related components may be scattered across folders
- Can become large as application grows

## 2. Depth-Based Organization

Organize by component complexity level, from simple to complex.

```
resources/js/
├── primitives/           # Basic building blocks
│   ├── Card.vue
│   ├── Button.vue
│   └── Input.vue
├── components/           # Single-purpose components
│   ├── HeaderTools.vue
│   ├── NavigationItems.vue
│   └── SampleToolsList.vue
├── layouts/              # Layout containers
│   ├── MainLayout.vue
│   └── ThreeColumnLayout.vue
├── composites/           # Multi-component assemblies
│   ├── TestingWorkspace.vue
│   └── SampleComponentWithThreeColumn.vue
└── pages/               # Top-level page components
```

primitives/           # Basic building blocks
├── components/           # Single-purpose components
├── layouts/              # Layout container
├── composite/           # Multi-component assemblies
└── pages/          

**Benefits:**
- Clear hierarchy from simple to complex
- Easy to understand component dependencies
- Natural progression for development workflow
- Reduces "where does this belong?" confusion

**Drawbacks:**
- May need to move components as they evolve in complexity

## 3. Domain + Type Hybrid

Combine feature domains with component type organization.

```
resources/js/
├── shared/              # Reusable across domains
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── utils/
├── testing/             # Testing domain
│   ├── primitives/      # Basic testing components
│   ├── composites/      # Complex testing assemblies
│   └── pages/          # Testing pages
└── codemate/           # Codemate domain
    ├── primitives/
    ├── composites/
    └── pages/
```

**Benefits:**
- Keeps related functionality together
- Clear separation between shared and domain-specific
- Scales well with multiple features
- Reduces cross-domain coupling

**Drawbacks:**
- Can lead to duplication if not careful with shared components
- More complex directory structure

## 4. Atomic Design Pattern

Based on Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology.

```
resources/js/
├── atoms/               # Basic building blocks
│   ├── Button.vue
│   ├── Card.vue
│   └── Input.vue
├── molecules/           # Simple component groups
│   ├── HeaderTools.vue
│   ├── NavigationMenu.vue
│   └── ToolsList.vue
├── organisms/           # Complex component assemblies
│   ├── TestingWorkspace.vue
│   ├── MainSidebar.vue
│   └── ThreeColumnLayout.vue
├── templates/           # Page-level layout templates
│   ├── MainLayout.vue
│   └── SidebarWithTestingLayout.vue
└── pages/              # Complete pages
```
blocks, 
**Benefits:**
- Well-established design system methodology
- Clear component hierarchy and relationships
- Great for design system consistency
- Easy to understand for designers and developers

**Drawbacks:**
- Can be overkill for smaller applications
- Requires discipline to maintain proper categorization

## 5. Simple Flat with Clear Naming

Keep it simple with descriptive naming conventions.

```
resources/js/
├── components/
│   ├── TestingHeaderTools.vue
│   ├── TestingNavigationItems.vue
│   ├── TestingMainContent.vue
│   ├── TestingWorkspaceComposite.vue
│   ├── MainLayoutTemplate.vue
│   ├── ThreeColumnLayoutTemplate.vue
│   ├── SampleNavigationMolecule.vue
│   └── SampleToolsListMolecule.vue
└── pages/
```

**Benefits:**
- Extremely simple structure
- Easy to navigate and search
- Clear naming prevents confusion
- No nested directory complexity

**Drawbacks:**
- Can become overwhelming with many components
- Less organized as application scales
- Harder to enforce component relationships

## Recommendations

### For Small to Medium Applications
**Depth-Based Organization (#2)** is recommended because:
- Clear progression from simple to complex
- Easy to understand component relationships
- Natural place for everything
- Scales well without becoming overwhelming

### For Large Applications or Design Systems
**Atomic Design Pattern (#4)** is recommended because:
- Well-established methodology
- Great for maintaining consistency
- Clear component hierarchy
- Works well with component libraries

### For Multi-Feature Applications
**Domain + Type Hybrid (#3)** is recommended because:
- Keeps related functionality together
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scales well with team growth
- Reduces cross-feature coupling

## Migration Strategy

If transitioning from the current structure:

1. **Start with shared components**: Move truly reusable components to a `shared/` directory
2. **Group by complexity**: Identify primitives, components, composites, and layouts
3. **Update imports gradually**: Change import paths one file at a time
4. **Update documentation**: Keep architecture documentation current
5. **Establish naming conventions**: Create clear rules for component naming and placement

## Naming Conventions

Regardless of the chosen pattern, consider these naming conventions:

- **Layout components**: End with "Layout" (e.g., `MainLayout.vue`)
- **Composite components**: End with "Composite" or "Workspace" (e.g., `TestingWorkspace.vue`)
- **Content components**: Descriptive names without special suffixes (e.g., `HeaderTools.vue`)
- **Sample/Demo components**: Prefix with "Sample" (e.g., `SampleNavigationMenu.vue`)

This helps maintain clarity about component purpose regardless of directory structure.
