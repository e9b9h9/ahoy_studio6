● Great question! Let me break down the difference
  between PHP arrays and JSON, and what each is used       
  for:

  PHP Array (What we currently return)

  return [
      'contents' => $fileContents,
      'metadata' => $fileMetadata
  ];

  What it is: A PHP data structure that exists in the      
  computer's memory
  Used for: Internal processing within PHP code
  Human readable: Only when you var_dump() or log it       
  for debugging
  Computer processing: Fast and efficient for PHP to       
  work with

  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

  return json_encode([
      'contents' => $fileContents,
      'metadata' => $fileMetadata
  ]);

  What it is: A text string format that looks like:        
  {"contents":"file content
  here","metadata":{"file_name":"test.php"}}
  Used for:
  - Sending data between systems (APIs)
  - Storing data in databases as text
  - Frontend JavaScript consumption
  - Human-readable data exchange

  In Your Context:

  Current flow:
  - FileDataGet returns PHP array →
  InitializeFileService processes it → Stays in PHP        

  If you use JSON:
  - FileDataGet returns JSON string →
  InitializeFileService would need json_decode() to use    
   it

  The Question:

  Since you're staying within PHP (not sending to
  frontend/API), do you want:
  1. PHP array (efficient for internal processing)
  2. JSON string (if you plan to store/transmit this       
  data later)

  What's your intended use case?
